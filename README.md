# Cognifyz_Intership_Tasks
This project explores insights from a restaurant dataset using Python. The goal is to understand dining trends, customer preferences, and service offerings by analyzing cuisines, ratings, price ranges, delivery options, and geographic patterns.

It includes both exploratory data analysis and visualizations to answer key business questions such as:

What are the most popular cuisines?

Which cities have the best-rated restaurants?

Do higher-priced restaurants offer more services?

Where are restaurants geographically clustered?
